# 🚀 How to Deploy Your Game to the Web

## What We Just Set Up

I've configured your project to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages whenever you make changes. Here's what this means in simple terms:

- **GitHub Pages**: A free service that turns your code into a website
- **Automatic Deployment**: Every time you save changes and push them to GitHub, your game goes live automatically
- **Free Hosting**: Your game will be available online at no cost

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Save Your Changes
First, let's save all the new files we just created:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Setup GitHub Pages deployment"
```

### 2. Push to GitHub
Send your changes to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages
Now you need to tell GitHub to turn on the website feature:

1. Go to your GitHub repository (the page where your code is stored)
2. Click on **Settings** (near the top)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Click **Save**

### 4. Wait for Deployment
- GitHub will automatically start building your game
- This usually takes 2-5 minutes
- You can watch the progress in the **Actions** tab of your repository

### 5. Your Game Goes Live!
Once deployment is complete, your game will be available at:
```
https://[your-username].github.io/urpg/
```

## 🔄 Making Updates

Every time you want to update your game:

1. Make changes to your code
2. Save the files
3. Run: `git add . && git commit -m "Update game" && git push`
4. Wait 2-5 minutes for the new version to go live

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**If something goes wrong:**
- Check the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
- Look for any red X marks (errors)
- Make sure all your code changes are saved and pushed

**If the website doesn't work:**
- Wait a few more minutes (deployment can be slow)
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
- Make sure you're using the correct URL

## 🎉 You're Done!

That's it! Your game will now be available online for anyone to play. The best part is that every time you make improvements, they'll automatically appear on your website.

## 📱 Testing Your Game

Once it's live, you can:
- Play it on your computer
- Test it on your phone
- Share the link with friends
- Show it off to anyone!

Your game is now a real website! 🌟
